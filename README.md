# A-Graphical-User-Interface-GUI-Based-Filters-App-Using-OpenCV

Digital image processing has seen a wide variety of applications in the field of pictorial information for human interpretation, and processing of image data for tasks such as storage, transmission, and extraction of pictorial information. Nowadays in the era of technology, most of the applications relating to computer vision include filtering. This project paper developed a graphical user interface (GUI) based filters App using OpenCV. Different linear, statistical, derivative type filters have been considered for this app. This project also includes global and adaptive histogram equalization on image.
