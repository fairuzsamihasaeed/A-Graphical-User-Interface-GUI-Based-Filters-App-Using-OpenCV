# A-Graphical-User-Interface-GUI-Based-Filters-App-Using-OpenCV

Digital image processing has seen a wide variety of applications in the field of pictorial information for human interpretation, and processing of image data for tasks such as storage, transmission, and extraction of pictorial information. Nowadays in the era of technology, most of the applications relating to computer vision include filtering. This project developed a graphical user interface (GUI) based filters App using OpenCV. Different linear, statistical, derivative type filters have been considered for this app. This project also includes global and adaptive histogram equalization on image.
The python programm asks the user to select an image from the storage.
The program is designed for image size of 512x512, therefore, image larger or smaller than this size is resized to match the requirememnts.
In the GUI window, the user can select which filter to use including variables like kernel size, Sigma, direction dx or dy, gridsize, cliplimit, threshold etc.
This application comes with an .exe file available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vMnsQWPR_ryNtySgOQN8tbXOYwAp823i?usp=sharing.
